# Accurate-Date-and-Time-Button-JS

You've probably witnessed JavaScript do more amazing things, but wait till you see this!
This is a JavaScript powered button that displays accurate date and time within the browser whenever it's clicked.
Try it risk free!

My plans are to revisit this project in the near future and make it super fly.
